# COSI data challenge 1 example scipts and data file

This repository contain the example scripts and data files for DC 1

## Adding new data sets

The repository is setup to upload large files (*.rsp, *.sim , *.evta, *.tra, *.h5 + their *.gz forms) to the GitHub Large File Storage system instead of the git repository itself. This keeps the repository smaller but the files are still automatically updated on pull and commit.
But before you can *upload* new data files, please follow these instructions to set git-lfs up:
